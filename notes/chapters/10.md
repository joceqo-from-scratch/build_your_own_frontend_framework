# Chapter 10

components.js (updated)
- defineComponent have a render and state props every others props are methods. Before returning the Component, we attacj the methods to the componenent using the prototype chain. We first check that the property is not already in the component, so it does not override render for example.

objects.js (updated)
- hasOwnProperty, secure method so hasOwnProperty can't be replaced and is not vulnerable.

Once we had the methods to the component, all the others change a about making sure that when an event is called, it's the correct `this` (the component) in the call context, so the event call the right functions. To do so addEventListener need to bind/apply the component to the handler function. Once this is done we are making sure that in each mounting, patching we are giving hostComponent if it's a component.

## Chapter 10 book summary

In chapter 10, you modified the defineComponent() function to include custom methods in the componentâ€™s prototype. You had to modify the addEventListeners() function so that if the element to which the listener is to be attached has a host component, the listener is bound to it. This change required you to modify the mountDOM(), createElementNode(), and createFragmentNodes() functions. You also modified the patchDOM(), patchElement(), and patchEvents() functions in all cases to add the host component argument that needs to be passed around so that the addEventListeners() function can access it.
