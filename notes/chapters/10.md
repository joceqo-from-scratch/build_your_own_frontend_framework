# Chapter 10

components.js (updated)
- defineComponent have a render and state props every others props are methods. Before returning the Component, we attacj the methods to the componenent using the prototype chain. We first check that the property is not already in the component, so it does not override render for example.

objects.js (updated)
- hasOwnProperty, secure method so hasOwnProperty can't be replaced and is not vulnerable.

Once we had the methods to the component, all the others change a about making sure that when an event is called, it's the correct `this` (the component) in the call context, so the event call the right functions. To do so addEventListener need to bind/apply the component to the handler function. Once this is done we are making sure that in each mounting, patching we are giving hostComponent if it's a component.
