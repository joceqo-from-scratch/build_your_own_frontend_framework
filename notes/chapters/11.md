# Chapter 11

components.js (updated)
- get elements, because component can have fragment in it and we need to have the firstElement right to patch the node correctly. We reccursly call child.component.elements if the component contain components
- updateProps, add the new props to the props obect and patch(so re-render)

destroy-dom.js (updated)
just call `vdom.component.unmount()` for component vdom

h.js (updated)
- add DOM_TYPES.COMPONENT
- h, return element or component wheter the tag is a string or a function(a class is a function)

mount-dom.js (updated)
- mountDOM, added a case for DOM_TYPES.COMPONENT
- createComponentNode, instanciate the component with the props, call the mount method and save comoponent and element references

patch-dom.js (updated)
- handle the case to patch a component
- patchComponent, update the props and the references.

## A rendering optimization (optional)
