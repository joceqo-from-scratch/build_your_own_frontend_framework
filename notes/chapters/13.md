# Chapter 13

you want to mount the entire application synchronously and then execute all the onMounted() hooks in the order in which they were encountered, ensuring that they complete and their errors are handled.

## Changes

- component.js (update)
we added two lifecycles methods onMounted and onUnmounted (defined as empty function by default). To handle async we use Promise.resolve also we bind or rather call the function with the right this. 

- destroy-dom.js (update)
when we destroy / unmount a component, we are enqeueing the unmount method in the scheduler.

- mount-dom.js (update)
when we mount a component we a enqeueing the onmonted method to the scheduler

- scheduler.js (created)
  - create a singleton of jobs
  - call https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/queueMicrotask to add a callback function with within the lifecycle method in it and handle async error. To not make multiples update in parallel
