# Chapter 5

this chapter is quite important as it re-use what have been set in place before and we can render a dumb version of a page. Dumb because if you have an input everytime you type, the page unmount / remount and you lose input focus.

app.js
- createApp, expose a renderApp function that mount the DOM. Keep track of the parentElement, the vdom and the events to trigger. Return 2 function, one to re mount and a clean up function unmount.

dispatcher.js
- classs to add and suscriber and dipatch them. Also have an afterEveryCommand to make something happens after every command like re-render
