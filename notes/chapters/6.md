# Chapter 6

chapter 6 focus on publishing your framework. But i skipped it, i rather just build the runtime, and add the examples linking the created package to make sure everything was working correctly.

You can link package by doing npm link where there is a package.json and using the name defined npm link <name> in another directory. Linked package are not listed in package.json but are in the node_modules
